       - Play will take place on a square map, with obstacles symmetrically placed within it.<br>
	-2-4 players spawn at the same time with one player in each of the 4 corners of the arena. Which corner each player spawns in is random, with no two players in same corner.<br>
	-Players cannot move outside of the enclosed map.<br>
	-The players avatar follows the players mouse. They have a constant speed but their direction is determined by where the cursor is relative to the avatar.<br>
	-Each avatar has a ‘spike’ with which they attack other players. The rest of the avatar is vulnerable to attack.<br>
	-Each player begins with three lives.<br>
	-A player that is hit in the back loses 1 life, being hit in the front causes neither player damage.	<br>
	-A player who is hit becomes invincible for a short time (1-3 seconds) after behing hit. They are also unable to ram other players while invincible. <br>
	-A player with 0 life left results in their elimination from the game. <br>
	-Hitting a launch pad increases speed of player, and allows player to select their launch angle.<br>
	-Running into a wall at launch pad-induced speed will result in the player being unable to move for  a short time (1 - 2 seconds)
	-Players have a set turning speed for moving. After being launched from a pad turning speed is reduced.<br>
	-Being the last player alive results in the player winning and the game ending.<br>
