CSCE 315 GAME

The game is pretty much divided up into two sections. On the client side, 
the client_index is used. This client_index file is used to connect and
communicate with the server.js file. The client_index maintains a canvas
and updates locations of itself and other players while also sending to 
the server file where its mouse is so that the server file can calculate
how to move the piece in that direction as well as the consequences for 
said action. The server is the site used for communication. We used
sockets for our communication and when any information is needed to be
sent or received, sockets.on is used. Server.js loads the box2d library
which is the major library used to generate the shapes controlled by the
players as well as dictate their movement. Game.js is included by the 
server.js file.



=======================================================================


--CLIENT SIDE--

client_index:	The client_index file has just a couple of major
		purposes. It connects to the server and sends a "ready"
		message using the socket, it sends the current position 
		of the user's piece, sends whether or not the mouse 
		left click is held down, and it sends the x and y 
		coordinants of the user's pointer. 

		The socket is initialized at the beginning to a port 
		that has been hardcoded in. The default port is the 
		compute.cse.tamu.edu:24130 port. The next function
		sends a ready message to the server if it has connected.

		Two seperate event listeners work to tell the server
		when the left click of the mouse is held down using a
		variable isMouseDown. If it is held down, another
		function is called named handleMouseMove.

		handleMouseMove calculates the position on the gameboard
		where the user's mouse is. it then logs that position to 
		the console and emits this data to the server so that it
		can calculate how the piece should be moving.

		the function getElementPosition is just used for the 
		maintenance of the canvas in the html doc.


=======================================================================		


--SERVER SIDE--

game.js:	The game.js file is where most of the calculations as
		far as the movement and pieces is done.
		
		Initially, all the shapes and objects are declared or
		defined. the body object, fixture object, and world are
		all created. the Function createWall is used to create 
		the walls that go along the outside of the level it will
		used in another function.

		The createArena function is where all the walls are drawn
		and the positions at which each player starts is
		established. 

		The user's pieces characteristics are then defined, giving
		different parts different characteristics. The piece, is 
		divided into two different parts; the horn and the body.
		The horns are the part of the piece that has to make
		contact with the other piece for it to harm them.

		the add_player funciton does just that. Upon connection,
		the function creates another body and sets its individual
		characteristics.

		The beginContact listener listens for a collision of some
		sort. This could either be a player-player collision or
		a player-environment collision. If it's a player-player
		collision it determines which player hurt the other
		player, decrements its lives, and stuns the hitting player
		so that he doesn't immediately rehit the player. If the 
		collision was with a wall, it stuns the player for a few
		moments, leaving him vulnerable from an attack.

		The rotate_to_mouse function manages the direction of the 
		piece. If the mouse position is not straight ahead, (which
		it almost never is) this function works to turn the piece
		at a set speed so that it can now go in that direction. If
		the direction is opposing the movement of its current 
		direction, it slows down the piece and works to send the 
		piece in that direction.

		The destroy_body function is used to destroy bodies when
		they are out of health as well as when they are
		disconnected from the server. 

		the update function, takes the position and speed of a
		piece to manage its movement, speed, and direction. It 
		looks to see if the mouse is being held down, and then
		sets variables accordingly. It also gets the position of
		the user's piece and mouse location. It defines how often
		this function will update and returns all the relevant data
		for the piece.


server.js:	The server file is the hub of communication. It holds a
		connection with the clients and also uses the game.js
		file to take data and do the appropriate thing with it.

		The function handler loads the client_index file as well
		as the Box2D library. 

		The io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket) { 
		notifies other players when a player is connected and 
		increments the number of players so that another player
		will be added to the gameboard.	
	
		The disconnect function notifies the clients that a player
		has been disconnected and destroys the body associated with
		that client.

--RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS--

In order to run our program, you must download the submitted code, get on 
putty and connect to the compute.cse.tamu.edu server. Once you have 
navigated to the directory containing the files, type in "node server.js".
This should start the server. If you are within the computer science's 
VPN, you should be able to connect to the game by going to 
http://compute.cse.tamu.edu:24130. This is the default port that we run our
server on.
